Dominion-Unstoppable
====================

Creativity and Inspirational

I graduated from the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria with a B.Sc Hons and Diploma in Computer Science (Second Class Upper Division) and presently awaiting my M.Sc. in Computer Science result from Ahmadu Bello University. I also have certifications in different IT courses (SQL, Java Programming, Desktop Publishing), Mobile Health by USAID and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Certificate of Accomplishment on Maps and the Geospatial Revolution from The University of Pennsylvania State University Online.

Presently, I work with an International NGO based in Kano as a Geographical Information Systems
(GIS) Operations Team Member/Assistant Coordinator and also as a team lead on the Polio
Vaccination Project and Data collection across the Northern states of Nigeria. I am involved in the GIS Tracking System which is part of the global initiative to eradicate polio in Nigeria and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In the course of my duty, I have successfully done GIS Tracking with excellent performance in the
high risk LGAs of Katsina, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kano States. I have also been able to explain the
projects successfully to Ward Focal Persons and the relevant stakeholders in the polio vaccination
campaign during Immunization Plus Days (IPDs). Coupled with this, I've done data collection of
settlement points in remote and extremely volatile locations in Zamfara, Katsina, Kebbi, Bauchi,
Kaduna, Sokoto and Kano States all in other to create an accurate map for the Northern region of
Nigeria in eradication of polio.

In addition, I am presently working on OpenStreetMap (OSM) using JOSM in digitizing all the roads and health facilities in all the local governments in the Northern states of Nigeria so as to be able to navigate and transport equipment and vaccines using GPS devices effectively and also be able to monitor and navigate vaccinators to there respective settlements for vaccinaton.
